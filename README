This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2071

Probably you want to try http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=90 instead. It's much more powerful

Default mapping are provided by

vl#dev#versioncontrolsystem#manager#VCSUI()
(and see the tagging UI function below)

Eg when committing you'll get a new window like this:
=============  =======================================================

VCCommit

  press <m-h> for a short help, <m-f> when you have finished

@#@ /pr/svnnix/trace/nixpkgs/trunk/ :
@#@ /pr/svnnix/trace/nixpkgs/trunk/pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix :
@#@ comment for all (additional comments will be added below this) :
=============  =======================================================

Either place you comment below the last line (comment for all)
Or add individual comments for each file (a svn commit will then be executed for each of them)
The comment for all will be added as well in this case

If a file hasn't been added it will be added automatically.

See the **tagging.vim file (defining b:tagged) which tells the script which
files to add / commit

It does also define the command UntagAll

You want to call vl#lib#ui#tagging#TaggingUI() to add the <m-t><m-g> mapping
toggling the tagged status.

I've been using this script for quite while now.
It's not finished but it does all I need most of the time.

If you have trouble (errors) then try
:echo g:systemResult
which shows the last command output much nicer then the exception

Feel free to sent me a mail with any questions/ enhancements etc.
